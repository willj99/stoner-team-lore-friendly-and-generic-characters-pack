# Stoner Team's Lore Friendly Character Pack
This is a character pack for The Simpsons Hit & Run. Use and tweak these models to your hearts content and come up with your own characters for your mods.

Some of these are based off us ourselves, but some are truly generic or are from Stoner Team affiliated works.

The following dev models are from the upcoming Futurama Hit & Run, just repainted.
- george_m
- will_m
- tom_m

# How to use these:

Reference the character in your scripts by the skeleton name, if you wish to give them dialogue assign 
a character code and index using the CustomDialogueCharacter codes hack.

To use these as playable characters, you will need to create an animation p3d, ie: will_a.p3d, and a cho script which defines the animations.
